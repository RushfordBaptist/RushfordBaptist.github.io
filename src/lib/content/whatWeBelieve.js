			title: '## Statement of Faith',
			content: `1. We believe the Scripture of both the Old and New Testaments is the Word of God, given by verbal inspiration without error, and that it is the final authority in faith and practice.
2. We believe in a Triune God, eternally existing as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
3. We believe Jesus Christ, Godâ€™s only begotten Son, was begotten of the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary, and is true God and true Man.
4. We believe man was created in the image of God, that he sinned by disobedience and rebellion against the holy command of God, and thereby incurred physical and spiritual death; and that all are born with a sinful nature, and at age of accountability become sinners in thought, word, and deed, and are thereby in need of salvation.
5. We believe that God so loved this world that He gave His only begotten Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, who died for the sins of all; and that all who believe in and receive Him are justified through His shed blood, are born again by the Holy Spirit, and thus become children of God.
6. We believe that God is just in justifying all who believe in Jesus Christ, and that there is salvation in no other way but by receiving Him as Savior by faith, even such a faith as always works by love, is attended by godly sorrow for sin, and causes a cheerful obedience to God's Word.
7. We believe that all believers are reproved of sin and are sealed by the Holy Spirit, causing them to rest on Christ for salvation, and are kept by the power of God through faith unto the redemption of the body.
8. We believe in the bodily resurrection the ascension, and the present High Priesthood of the Lord Jesus Christ.
9. We believe in the pretribulational, premillennial, personal return of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, as the "blessed hope" of all believers.
10. We believe in the bodily resurrection of the just and the unjust, the everlasting blessedness of the saved, and the everlasting conscious punishment of the lost.`,

			title: '## Church Covenant',
			content: `Having been led, as we believe, by the Spirit of God, to receive the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior, and on the profession of our faith, having been baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, we do now in the presence of God and this assembly, most solemnly and joyfully enter into covenant withone another, as one body in Christ.

We engage, therefore, by the aid of the Holy Spirit, to walk together in Christian love; to strive for the advancement of this church in knowledge, holiness, and comfort; to promote its prosperity and spirituality; to sustain its worship, ordinances, discipline, and doctrines: to contribute cheerfully and regularly to the support of the ministry, the expenses of the church, the relief of the poor, and the spread of the Gospel through all nations.

We also engage to maintain family and personal devotion; to religiously educate our children; to seek the salvation of our families and acquaintances; to walk cautiously in the world; to be just in our dealings, faithful in our engagements, and exemplary in our deportment; to avoid all tattling, backbiting, and excessive anger; to abstain from drunkenness, drug abuse, fornication, adultery, homosexuality and pornography; in matters of individual conscience, we will neither judge each other nor cause each other to stumble; and above all, we will be zealous in our efforts to advance the kingdom of our Savior.

We further engage to watch over one another in brotherly love; to remember each other in prayer; to aid each other in sickness and distress; to cultivate Christian sympathy in feeling and courtesy in speech; to be slow to take offense, but always ready for reconciliation, and mindful of the rules of our Savior, to secure it without delay.

We moreover engage, therefore, that when we remove from this place we will as soon as possible unite with some other church where we can carry out the spirit of this covenant and the principles of God's Word.`,
